mvc using servlet and jsp 

jsp gets converted into servlet 

jsp --> working with servlet 

servlet is abit faster

dont write business logic inside jsp 

servlet is for processing 

why use jsp when u have html ? jsp can generate dynamic pages

jsp will have some static content and some dynamic content

create a layout using jsp --> 

when u request for a page --> u want jsp in return --> u r expecting the view 
as a client u only care about the view 
u just want the page 

you want data in the view --> how to get data 

lets say you send a request for /getPage --> this request will go to controller 

controller will call view .. and view will be sent to client 
somethign is missing 
view dont have data

controller will send data as well to the view ... it is an object POJO
which is a model

servlet is created with controller
view is jsp
model is java class POJO

===============================


processing should be done on controller or model 
never perform operations in model object

N Tier architecture in java

controller connect to database --> but dont do it there directly 

never write functionality in controller 

controller call service--> service will call DAO --> which will in turn call the DB 

client controller model view 


=========================


JSTL --> jsp standard tag library 

why we use this .. 
in jsp we write java code inside html 

convert java into html like code 


in this video we will talk about filters in servlets

lets say we have client and server
and on the server we have 3 servlets 

whenever a client sends a request 
request goes to web.xml and from there it goes to relevant servlet

lets say for two of the servers you want to maintain logs

instead of writing those things inside a and b, can we take it out?
take common things out 
the common thing can be plugged it in anywhere 

we can add filter in between as the request goes to the server

the filter will intercept the request

tomcat says that if you have multiple filters, yhou have to chain them
filter chaining
where to configure all these things? web.xml
to create a filter create a class and extend something
